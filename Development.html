        A few of my strengths is namely that i don't give up irrespective    </br>
        of what is perceived feasible before hand or not. I'm also calm       </br>
        throughout situations which allows me to efficiently reason and       </br>
        focus, while another strength is that i can easily build meaningful     </br>
        bonds and relationships which i think shapes a person especially        </br>
        over the few years i have been doing so.                                 </br>
